# Course
This program demonstrates how to use an ArrayList of custom objects, how to sort an ArrayList using a comparator, and how to use various other methods of the ArrayList class.

# Description
This program is a Java program that uses an ArrayList of "Course" objects to demonstrate various features of the ArrayList class and the Comparator interface. The program begins by creating an ArrayList of "Course" objects and adding several Course objects to it. It then prints the contents of the ArrayList using a helper method called "printList".

The program then sorts the ArrayList using a comparator that compares the number of students in each course and then prints the sorted ArrayList. It then swaps the first and second element in the ArrayList and prints the ArrayList again.

The program then creates a clone of the ArrayList and adds two more Course objects to it. It then sorts the cloned ArrayList by the name of the course and prints it. The program then finds the index of a specific course in the cloned ArrayList and prints it.

The program then finds the disjoint courses from both ArrayList and then it sorts the cloned ArrayList by the number of students and prints the course with the maximum and minimum number of students.
